"Road Warrior" Music Tour Management Tool by Brent Rusinow

Installation: use "git clone" to copy to your computer and then open in your preferred browser.

Technologies used: AngularJS, Ionic, Cordova, Firebase, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, moment.js.

APIs Used: Yelp, Google Places, Google Geolocation, Yahoo Weather.


Room for improvement: 
* desktop version (which will mostly be used by tour managers for data entry)
* allowing users to connect to see when friends are playing in the same place
* offline data persistence (Firebase currently only offers this for native iOS or Android development, not their web based solution)
